# kernel-decompress-hook

A Ubuntu kernel postinst hook which decompresses LZ4-compressed kernels.

Ubuntu started compressing their kernels with LZ4 as of the 19.10 release, and not all software yet supports that.

## Who needs this

This repository exists for people who are upgrading from an earlier version of Ubuntu and need the hook to have a bootable kernel, or just in case it helps anyone else.
